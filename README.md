#### By Maggie Harrington

## Description

_A divisibility game of numerical Ping Pong built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery. The program counts up from one to the user-inputted number by ones, displaying each number along the way. All displayed numbers divisible by 3 will instead display "ping", numbers divisible by 5 will display "pong", and numbers divisible by 15 will display "pingpong". All other numbers will just display the number._
